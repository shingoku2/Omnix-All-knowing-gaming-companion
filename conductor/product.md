# Initial Concept
Omnix is a sophisticated desktop AI gaming companion designed to enhance the gaming experience through automated game detection, AI-powered assistance, macro automation, and session coaching. It leverages local LLMs (via Ollama) to ensure privacy and offline capability.

# Product Guide: Omnix

## Vision
Omnix aims to be the universal, privacy-first companion for all PC gaming. Our vision combines deep strategic analysis for competitive titles with a robust platform for community-driven game knowledge and automation. We strive to integrate seamlessly with every major game title, providing a strategic edge while maintaining the highest standards of user privacy through local execution.

## Problem Statement
Omnix addresses the friction and privacy risks in modern gaming:
- **The Alt-Tab Friction:** Gamers often lose immersion and momentum by having to alt-tab to search for wikis, guides, or lore.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Most AI assistants rely on cloud processing, exposing sensitive gameplay and personal data.
- **Lack of Real-time Insight:** Existing tools rarely provide context-aware, real-time strategic coaching that adapts to the current game state.

## Target Audience
- **Competitive Gamers:** Players seeking a strategic edge and performance improvement through session recaps and real-time coaching.
- **Casual Players:** Gamers who want immediate, immersive access to game mechanics, lore, and quick tips without leaving the game environment.
- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Users who demand high-performance AI tools but refuse to compromise on data sovereignty or local execution.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Game Detection:** Real-time monitoring of running processes to instantly load game-specific profiles and knowledge bases.
- **Modular AI Integration:** Support for local LLMs via Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible API (LM Studio, AnythingLLM), ensuring cost-free, private, and offline-capable AI inference.
- **In-Game Overlay:** A modern, customizable React-based UI that provides assistance directly over the game window, seamlessly integrated via a hybrid architecture.
- **Knowledge Integration:** Semantic search across PDFs, wikis, and documents for context-aware answers.
- **Session Coaching:** AI-powered analysis of gameplay patterns to provide personalized improvement insights.

## Success Metrics
- **Seamless Integration:** Achieving zero-latency detection and profile switching that feels like a native part of the game.
- **Intelligence Accuracy:** Providing high-relevance gaming advice and information that users can trust.
- **Performance Efficiency:** Maintaining a negligible footprint on system resources to ensure the user's frame rate remains unaffected.

## Future Roadmap
- **Automated Session Recap:** Post-game analysis of gameplay patterns and AI interactions.
- **UI Logging Dashboard:** Real-time visibility into system logs and AI processing state.
